# snake-js

**snake-js** is a minimalistic snake clone written using vanilla JavaScript. You can play it on [fragstiller.github.io/snake-js](https://fragstiller.github.io/snake-js/). This project was primary made for me to practice JavaScript, but in the end it managed to become one of the most playable versions of snake, at least in my opinion. Feel free to suggest new features if you want anything added or to implement them yourself.

## Mobile support

**snake-js** fully supports playing on mobile, so you can get some old school Nokia vibes ;)

However, there are some nuances:
* game was only fully tested in Google Chrome, so i recommend to use it for playing. Firefox should also be mostly fine, Safari might have some issues, other browsers are untested and unrecommended
* phones smaller than about iPhone 6 will have problems with displaying the game
