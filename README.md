# snake-js

**snake-js** is a minimalistic snake clone written using vanilla JavaScript. You can play it on [fragstiller.github.io/snake-js](https://fragstiller.github.io/snake-js/). This project was primarily made for me to practice JavaScript, but in the end it managed to become one of the most playable versions of snake, at least in my opinion :^)

## Mobile Platforms Support

**snake-js** fully supports playing on mobile platforms, so you can get some old school Nokia vibes :^)

However, there are some nuances:
* the game was only fully tested in Google Chrome, so i would recommend to use it for the best experience. Firefox should also be mostly fine, Safari might have some issues, other browsers are untested and unrecommended
* some smaller screen sizes might be incompatable, since the game will not fully fit in
