# snake-js

**snake-js** is a minimalistic snake clone written with vanilla JavaScript. You can play it on [fragstiller.github.io/snake-js](https://fragstiller.github.io/snake-js/). This project was primary made for me to practice JavaScript, but in the end it managed to become one of the most playable versions of snake, at least in my opinion. Feel free to suggest new features if you want anything added or to implement them yourself.
